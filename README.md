# stockInfoapp
A stock information android app i thought of and built while experimenting with android studio.

**Use case of the app** 
Users who want to access news and surface level information of a stock of their interest.

App uses API from https://polygon.io/ and "https://newsapi.org/v2/". Hence limited to US stocks only.

**Current Features**:
App currently displays basic stock information, financials, YTD Stock Chart and related Stock-news.

**Future Features that i am thinking of to implement:**
Interactive and dynamic Stock Chart if there is cheap or free API avaliable to request stock price and datetime data from
Improve search bar to autocomplete if there is cheap or free API avaliable to request stock ticker from
Adding a portfolio simulation analytics feature such as volatility, sharpe ratio and returns calculations
