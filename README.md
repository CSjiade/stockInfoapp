# stockInfoapp
A stock info aggregator android app built while experimenting with android development.

**Use case of the app** 
Users who want to access surface level information of a stock and those who also want to keep abreast of news related to a stock of their interest.

App uses the free API version from https://polygon.io/ and https://newsapi.org/. Hence limited to US stocks only.

**Current Features**:
App currently displays basic stock information, financials, YTD Stock Chart and related Stock-news to the stock searched.

**Future Features that i am thinking of to implement:**<br />
Interactive and dynamic Stock Chart if there is cheap or free API avaliable to request stock price and datetime data from.<br />
Experiment with push notification when there is a breaking news <br />
Adding a portfolio simulation analytics feature such as volatility, sharpe ratio and returns calculations
